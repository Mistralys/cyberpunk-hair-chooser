# Cyberpunk 2077 Hair Chooser

PHP tool to choose hairs from multiple mods, and create custom hair mods 
to easily change hairstyles during a playthrough.

## What does it do?

The tool looks through all your hair mods, and gives you the possibility
to select which hairstyle to use for each available hair slot. It then
creates a custom mod that can be loaded with your preferred mod manager 
to make them available in the game.

## Why is this needed?

Available hairstyles in Cyberpunk 2077 are fixed: It is only possible 
to replace existing hairstyles, not add new ones. 

Additionally, hairstyle mods are created for a specific numbered hair 
slot, so if you want to use multiple hairstyle mods at the same time,
you need to check which slots the mods replace to avoid conflicts.

This tool aims to simplify the process.
